DAY-13 P1:

Imagine you're managing a busy warehouse where every product is delivered in 
pairs to ensure proper stocking. However, due to a mix-up at the shipping dock, 
two unique product IDs ended up without their matching pair, while all other 
products arrived as complete pairs. Your task is to identify these two solitary 
product IDs.

You're given list of product IDs. In this list, every product ID appears exactly 
twice except for two IDs that appear only once. Return these two unique product 
IDs in any order.

You must design an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses only constant 
extra space.


Example 1:
----------
Input: 
101 102 101 103 102 105  
Output: 
[103, 105] 
 
Explanation: The IDs 103 and 105 appear only once, while all other IDs appear 
twice. [105, 103] is also an acceptable answer.

Example 2:
-----------
Input: 121 136
Output: [121, 136] 


DAY-13 P2:

Bubloo is working with computer networks, where servers are connected 
in a hierarchical structure, represented as a Binary Tree. Each server (node) 
is uniquely identified by an integer value.

Bubloo has been assigned an important task: find the shortest communication 
path (in terms of network hops) between two specific servers in the network.

Network Structure:
------------------
The network of servers follows a binary tree topology.
Each server (node) has a unique identifier (integer).
If a server does not exist at a certain position, it is represented as '-1' (NULL).

Given the root of the network tree, and two specific server IDs (E1 & E2), 
determine the minimum number of network hops (edges) required to 
communicate between these two servers.

Input Format:
-------------
Space separated integers, elements of the tree.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer value.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
1 2 4 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
4 8

Sample Output-1:
----------------
4

Explanation:
------------
The edegs between 4 and 8 are: [4,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,8]


Sample Input-2:
---------------
1 2 4 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
6 6

Sample Output-2:
----------------
0

Explanation:
------------
No edegs between 6 and 6.

DAY-13 P3:

Imagine you are a secret agent tasked with sending encoded messages. 
Each original message is a string of lowercase letters, and you can disguise 
it by replacing selected, non-adjacent segments with the count of characters 
in those segments. However, the encoding must follow strict rules: only 
non-empty segments can be replaced, replacements cannot be adjacent, and any 
numbers used must not have leading zeros.

For instance, the message "substitution" can be encoded in various ways, such as:

• "s10n" (keeping 's', replacing the next 10 characters with 10, and ending with 'n')  
• "sub4u4" (keeping "sub", replacing 4 characters, then 'u', and replacing 4 more characters)  
• "12" (replacing the entire message with its length)  
• "su3i1u2on" (using a different pattern of replacements)  
• "substitution" (leaving the message unaltered)

Invalid encodings include:

• "s55n" (because the replaced segments are adjacent)  
• "s010n" (the number 010 has a leading zero)  
• "s0ubstitution" (attempts to replace an empty segment)

Your task is: given an original message and an encoded version, 
determine if the encoded version is a valid secret code for the message.


Sample Input-1: 
---------------
internationalization
i12iz4n
  
Sample Output-1: 
----------------
true  

Explanation: 
------------
"internationalization" can be encoded as "i12iz4n" by keeping 'i', 
replacing 12 letters, keeping "iz", replacing 4 letters, and then ending with 'n'.


Sample Input-2: 
---------------
apple
a2e
  
Sample Output-2:
----------------
false  

Explanation: 
------------
The encoding "a2e" does not correctly represent "apple".

Time Complexity: O(n) where n=max(len(word),len(abbr))
Auxiliary Space:  O(1).
