Day 9 programs

You are a database integrity engineer working for a global cloud company. 
Your team maintains a distributed database network, where each server either:
    - Stores equivalent data to another server (serverX == serverY).
    - Stores different data from another server (serverX != serverY).

The transitive consistency rule must be followed:
    - If A == B and B == C, then A == C must be true.
    - If A == B and B != C, then A != C must be true.

Your task is to analyze the given constraints and determine whether they 
follow transitive consistency. If all relations are consistent, return true; 
otherwise, return false

Input Format:
-------------
Space separated strnigs, list of relations

Output Format:
--------------
Print a boolean value, whether transitive law is obeyed or not.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
a==b c==d c!=e e==f

Sample Output-1:
----------------
true


Sample Input-2:
---------------
a==b b!=c c==a

Sample Output-2:
----------------
false

Explanation:
------------
{a, b} form one equivalence group.
{c} is declared equal to {a} (c == a), which means {a, b, c} should be equivalent.
However, b != c contradicts b == a and c == a.

Sample Input-3:
---------------
a==b b==c c!=d d!=e f==g g!=d

Sample Output-3:
----------------
true


You are given a crystal with an energy level n. Your goal is to discover all 
the different ways this crystal could have been created by combining smaller shards.

Each combination must:
- Use only shards with energy values between 2 and n - 1.
- Be represented as a list of shard values whose product equals n.
- Use any number of shards (minimum 2), and the order is ascending order.

Your task is to return all unique shard combinations that can multiply together 
to recreate the original crystal.

Example 1:
---------
Input:
28

Output:
[[2, 14], [2, 2, 7], [4, 7]]

Example 2:
----------
Input:
23

Output:
[]



Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^4
- Only shards with energy between 2 and n - 1 can be used.


Given the in-order and post-order traversals of a binary tree, construct 
the original binary tree. 

The output should list the nodes in the order they appear in pre-order.

Input Format:
-------------
An integer N representing the number nodes.
A space-separated list of N integers, the nodes in in-order traversal.
A space-separated list of N integers, the nodes in post-order traversal.

Output Format:
--------------
Print the list of the nodes in pre-order.


Sample Input:
-------------
7
4 2 5 1 6 3 7
4 5 2 6 7 3 1

Sample Output:
--------------
[1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7]
